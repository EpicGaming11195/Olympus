#changelog#
∙ Added a "Connectivity Test" screen, accessible from Options & Updates
∙ Better error reporting instead of "xxx not running!" errors
∙ Enabled compression and disabled IPv6 on API calls, hopefully fixing connection issues for some users
∙ Do not load URL to maddie480.ovh from everestapi.github.io for the Everest versions list
∙ Make sure an install is selected if any exists, which should fix the "no Everest button in main menu" bug
